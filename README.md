This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: insufficient error handling when parsing route parameters. The `bug.js` file shows the flawed code, which can crash or produce unexpected results if the user ID is not a valid integer. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that includes robust error handling.
